        Welcome to Mapaku Village!
      </p>
      <p>
        Named for a place in a world I built when I was first dipping my toes into 
        storytelling, Mapaku Village is where I publish my various books. Honestly, 
        I never thought I’d write a book, let alone three (and soon a fourth!), but 
        it’s been a wonderful experience—a creative outlet that I can share with 
        others, which is something I feel to be even more important in this day and age.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll find information here about my books and stories, as well as a bit about 
        me if you’re bored. There’s a link to my shop as well, if anything sparks your 
        interest!
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond reviews on Goodreads, Amazon, or other spots, people have reached out 
        to me directly to tell me what they thought of my books and what they meant to 
        them, and I think that is what affects me most as a writer. And it keeps me 
        going, fueling that drive to continue making stories for others to enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, a big thank you to all my readers, especially those who’ve taken the time 
        to write a review or contact me!
