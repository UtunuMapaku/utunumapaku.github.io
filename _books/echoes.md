Tales of times long past fill us with wonder, allowing us to envision lives and possibilities far from the worries of our own, very real world.

'Echoes' is a collection of short stories and poems written with anthropomorphic animals in mind. From tales of magic at the dawn of civilization to historical fiction of the antiquity and beyond, may they inspire you to dream of worlds all your own.
