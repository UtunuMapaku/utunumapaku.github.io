The sun dawns on a new world.<br />
Still reeling from their harrowing escape, Bori, Tuther, and Samna find themselves stranded and alone.

Bori’s psionic abilities are gone, and he despairs that he has doomed himself and his friends.<br />
Tuther struggles to heal his mate even as his own mind begins to stutter and crack.<br />
Samna does what he can to make sure their little group survives, while his newly developed talents lead to a discovery with profound implications for the future of both fennecs and hyenas.

Meanwhile, the consequences of their abrupt departure ripple throughout the colonies they’ve left behind. As troubling information from the distant past is unlocked, the three must keep both themselves and their society as a whole from being torn apart.
