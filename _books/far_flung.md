On the harsh, barren planet of Sands, in the small settlement of Oasis, live three young companions: the inseparable fennecs Bori and Tuther, and their best friend, the hyena Samna.

But Bori is psionic—and on the distant planet of Verdant, psionics are fervently sought. When the two planets align, a shuttle journeys between them, bringing needed resources to Sands and hoping to take gifted psionics back to lush Verdant in return.

The shuttle’s imminent arrival signifies opportunities for Oasis, but for the trio it instead evokes dread. For if Bori is chosen, he’d be taken from his dearest friends and the only home he’s ever known.

Bori would be broken without Tuther.<br />
Tuther would be broken without Bori.<br />
And Samna? All he can do is help make their remaining days together good ones.
